						In the flood of darkness, hope is the light. It brings comfort, faith, and confidence. It gives us guidance when we are lost, and gives support when we are afraid. And the moment we give up hope, we give up our lives. The world we live in is disintegrating into a place of malice and hatred, where we need hope and find it harder. In this world of fear, hope to find better, but easier said than done, the more meaningful life of faith will make life meaningful.

							I believe there is a person who brings sunshine into your life. That person may have enough to spread around. But if you really have to wait for someone to bring you the sun and give you a good feeling, then you may have to wait a long time.

							<h3>ONE REAL MAN</h3>

							The ruler of an ancient kingdom wanted to disprove the statement that the men of his domain were ruled by their wives. He had all the males in his kingdom brought before him and warned that any man who did not tell the truth would be punished severely（嚴格地，嚴厲地）.
							
							Then he asked all the men who obeyed their wives' directions and counsel（勸告，建議）to step to the left side of the hall. All the men did so but one little man who moved to the right.
							
							It's good to see , said the king , that we have one real man in the kingdom. Tell these chickenhearted（膽小的） dunces（傻瓜） why you alone among them stand on the right side of the hall.
							
							Your Majesty , came the reply in a squealing voice , it is because before l left home my wife told me to keep out of crowds.						  </div>
